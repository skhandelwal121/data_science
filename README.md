This is the main file which contains the entire code.

- Firstly, merged all 3 training files into 1.
- Then performed a basic eda of descriptive statistics and univariate graphs of each variable using pandas profiling.
- Then created a couple of bivariate graphs with respect to target variable i.e. wheather the person is defaulter or not
- Plotted a heatmap to check for corealtion between variables.
- Scaled the Data using StandardScalar: Bringing the data into a similar scale.
- Applied a simple RandomForest Model without any hyperparameter tuning
- Then using Grid Search Cross-Validation found out the best parameters to tune the model
- Finally, applied the Tuned model to get the predicted values for the tes file.
- Lastly, submitted the predicted values to Kaggle.

Result: Test results for Tuned RF generated an accuracy of ~81.7%

Software Configuraion: Python - 3.7.3 Jupyter Notebook - 5.7.8
